# PSP Homebrew Projects: Tutorial Series Overview

Welcome! This repository is a collection of PlayStation Portable (PSP) homebrew projects, each based on step-by-step tutorials. Every project demonstrates a different aspect of PSP development using C, SDL2, and related libraries. All code is cross-platform and can be built for both PSP and Linux.

## üõ†Ô∏è Building & Running

- **Toolchain:** [PSPSDK](https://github.com/pspdev/pspsdk) and [psp-cmake](https://github.com/pspdev/psptoolchain-extra)
- **Emulator:** [PPSSPP](https://www.ppsspp.org/)
- **Build System:** CMake (use `psp-cmake` for PSP builds)

**General Build Steps:**
```bash
mkdir build
cd build
psp-cmake ..   # For PSP
make
```
See each project‚Äôs README for Linux build instructions and asset requirements.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

- If EBOOT.PBP is not created or you get CMake errors about `create_pbp_file`, make sure you are using the `psp-cmake` script from your toolchain‚Äôs `bin` directory.
- For font/image/audio projects, required assets (fonts, images, music) must be in the build directory or as described in each project‚Äôs README.
- See each project‚Äôs README for more details and screenshots.
